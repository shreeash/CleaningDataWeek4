Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment Week 4 Repo
================================================

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is
wearable computing - see for example this article [web
link](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/).
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the
most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from
the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from
the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the
site where the data was obtained:

Run Data Analysis
-----------------

In this data set the goal is to assign descriptive names to the X, y and
subject data in train and test sets from features (for X) and
activity\_labels (for y) and "Subject\_ID" for subject data and then
merge into a single data set and extract measurements of mean and std
from the merged dataset. Then create a new dataset to include the
average of each measurement for each activity and each subject, called
tidy.txt.

Put the R code in a file called Run\_analysis.R.
